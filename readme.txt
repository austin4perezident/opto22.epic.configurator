Here is a stream-of-consciousness recall of our development items:

File management/getHub stuff

Website database connection: get part data from website, save configuration data to website, store configurations with user profile, share user configurations to shopping carts and to pre-sales. Pre-sales would be able to open a user’s configuration in his or her configurator.

Talk to Kyle and Selam for pre-sales features.

User interface: better use of style sheets, font types; drag-and-drop interface would be nice.
